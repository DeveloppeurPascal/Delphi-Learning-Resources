# Website template for languages/topics/links websites hosted on Github Pages

[This repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) is a template for web site generation with MD files.

## What does it do ?

this repository generate a 3 level website :
- index with list of languages
- a page for each language with its topics list
- a page for each topic with its links list

## Why a website and not simple MD/text files ?

Simply for visibility reasons. Markdown / text files are simple to use and maintain in a repository but we can only read them when we stay on repository platform.

It's not as visible on search engines than websites.

Creating the website from MD files is a sort of best of 2 worlds : MD files maintaining on Github is simple, generating the website is automatic, and we can use this website on GitHub Pages as any other website with links, SEO and SEA.

## How to use it ?

Copy this repository template as a new repository directly from GitHub.

Remove "/.github" folder or change the sponsor links in it (don't lets mine on your repos !).

Change the copyright in "/includes/footer.html" file if you want. By default it displays datas from your GitHub repository datas.

Edit the "/index.html" file to change it's "title" property.

Copy templates files (and rename copies) from "/_template_files_for_data_collections" folder to :
* "/_data_languages" for languages pages (one file per language)
* "/_data_topics" for topics pages (one file per language/topic with the same "family" property)
* "/_data_links" for links (as many files you need per language/topic)

After adapting your "css/styles.css" file, activate GitHub Pages on your repository (go to "Settings / Pages" for that).

GitHub will launch Jekyll on your repository from a GitHub action and generate a website each time you push your commits.

GitHub allow us to use our domaine name for free. For SEO reasons it's better than a subfolder on github.io domain. Do it if you want to share your work with the rest of the world !

## How to add a new language ?

As web site content, simply create a new file in "/_data_languages" folder by copying an existing one or the template.

As web site language you can copy one file from "/_translated_texts" and translate it.

In the two cases you need a flag. Check if it's already available in "/images" folder or add a new one.

## Where is it used ?

This repository was done after creating three "learning resources" websites for [Delphi](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/Delphi-Learning-Resources/), [Lazarus](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/Lazarus-Learning-Resources/) and [Pascal language](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/Pascal-Learning-Resources/) because I think it's simple to personalize and easy to use.

## Translations

The original standard texts where translated from FR or EN to CN, DE, DK, HU, JP, PL, RU, SE, SP and TR with [Deepl](https://deepl.com) translation service.
